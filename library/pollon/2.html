<h3>Node</h3>
Each node is just an HTML fragment stored on the server as a file
For example a document with one node would look like:
`document/0.html`
<pre>html
&ltarticle>
Unformatted text
&lt/article>
</pre>
As nodes are normal HTML files they can be edited by hand or read by basic tools.
You could swap the order of nodes with just `mv` .
Render a document from within the document folder:
<pre>cat $(ls -1v)</pre> 
Render and open in browser:
<pre>d=/tmp/doc.html;cat $(ls -1v) > $d;xdg-open $d</pre>
</article>
